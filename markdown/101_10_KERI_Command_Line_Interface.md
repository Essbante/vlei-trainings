# KERI Command Line Interface

  <b>üéØ OBJECTIVE</b><hr>
Introduce the KERI Command Line Interface (KLI) and demonstrate some of its basic utility commands.
</div>

## How to use KLI in Notebooks?

Throughout these notebooks, you will interact with the KERI protocol using the **KLI**. The KLI is the standard text-based tool for managing identifiers and infrastructure directly from your computer's terminal. 

Since you are working within Jupyter notebooks, the KLI commands are written with an exclamation mark prefix (`!`). This tells the notebook environment to run the command in the underlying system shell, rather than as Python code. So, you'll frequently see commands structured like this:

`!kli <command> [options]`  

**What can you do with KLI?**

The KLI provides a wide range of functionalities. Key capabilities include:
- **Identifier management**: Management and creation of keystores and identifiers
- **Utility functions**: Functions to facilitate KERI-related operations
- **Credential management**: Creation of credentials
- **Comunication operations**: Establishing connections between AIDs
- **IPEX actions**: To issue and present credentials
- **Others**: The KLI provides commands for most of the features available in the KERI and ACDC protocol implementation.

  <b>‚ÑπÔ∏è NOTE</b><hr>
    There are UI based methods to manage Identifiers, known as wallets, but for the purpose of this training, the KLI offers a good compromise between ease of use and visibility of technical details.

## Basic Utility Commands

Let's explore some helpful commands available in the **KERI Command Line Interface (KLI)**.

This isn't a complete list of every command, but it covers some essential utilities that you'll find useful as you work with KERI.

### KERI library version


```python
!kli version
```

    Library version: 1.2.6


### Generate a salt 
Create a new random salt (or seed). A salt is a random value used as an input when generating cryptographic key pairs to help ensure their uniqueness and security.


```python
# This will output a qualified base64 string representing the salt
!kli salt
```

### Generate a passcode
The passcode is used to encrypt your keystore, providing an additional layer of protection.


```python
# This will output a random string suitable for use as an encryption passcode
!kli passcode generate
```
