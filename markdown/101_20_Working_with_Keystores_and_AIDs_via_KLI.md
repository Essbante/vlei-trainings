# Working with Keystores and AIDs via KLI

<div class="alert alert-primary">
  <b>🎯 OBJECTIVE</b><hr>
    Demonstrate how to create a KERI keystore and then manage identifiers within it using the <code>kli init</code>, <code>kli incept</code>, and <code>kli list</code> commands.
</div>

## Initializing a Keystore

Before you can create identifiers or perform many other actions with KLI, you need a keystore. The keystore is an encrypted data store that holds the keys for your identifiers. To initialize a keystore, you give it a name, protect it with a passcode, and provide a salt for generating the keys.

The command to do this is `kli init`. Here's an example:



```python
# Choose a name for your keystore
keystore_name="my-first-key-store"
# Use a strong, randomly generated passcode (using a predefined one here, but can be created with 'kli passcode generate')
keystore_passcode="xSLg286d4iWiRg2mzGYca"
# Use a random salt (using a predefined one here, but can be created with 'kli salt')
keystore_salt="0ABeuT2dErMrqFE5Dmrnc2Bq"

!kli init --name {keystore_name} \
    --passcode {keystore_passcode} \
    --salt {keystore_salt}
```

    KERI Keystore created at: /usr/local/var/keri/ks/my-first-key-store
    KERI Database created at: /usr/local/var/keri/db/my-first-key-store
    KERI Credential Store created at: /usr/local/var/keri/reg/my-first-key-store
    	aeid: BD-1udeJaXFzKbSUFb6nhmndaLlMj-pdlNvNoN562h3z


The command sets up the necessary file structures for your keystore, so once executed, it's ready for you to create and manage Identifiers within it.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <b>ℹ️ NOTE</b><hr>
<ul>
    <li>In the example, predefined <code>--passcode</code> and <code>--salt</code> are used for convenience, but randomly generated values can be obtained using the <code>kli passcode generate</code> and <code>kli salt</code>
    <li>You can initialize multiple keystores as long as they have different names 
</ul>
</div>

## Creating an Identifier

Now that your keystore is set, you can create your first identifier (AID) within it using the `kli incept` command. You'll need to provide: 
- `--name` and `--passcode`: Think of it as the keystore access credentials `keystore_name` and `keystore_passcode`
- `--alias`: It will be difficult to recall an AID by its value. A human-readable `alias` is assigned using this parameter 
- `--icount` and `--isith`: the number of signing keys and the signing threshold, respectively. 
- Other parameters such as `--ncount`, `--nsith`, and `--toad` will be explained later. 

Executing `kli incept` will create the AID and output the prefix. This also means that the command will add the first event to the AID KEL, the inception event.

Proceed and create your first AID:
 


```python
# Choose a human-readable alias for your identifier within this keystore
aid_alias = "my-first-aid"

# Create (incept) the identifier
!kli incept --name {keystore_name} \
    --passcode {keystore_passcode} \
    --alias {aid_alias} \
    --icount 1 \
    --isith 1 \
    --ncount 0 \
    --nsith 0 \
    --toad 0
```

    Prefix  BHt9Kw8oUgfB2kiyoj65B2VE5fZLr87S5MJP3l4JeRwC
    	Public key 1:  BHt9Kw8oUgfB2kiyoj65B2VE5fZLr87S5MJP3l4JeRwC
    


## The Prefix

The `kli incept` command generated an AID. The unique string produced, `BHt9Kw8oUgfB2kiyoj65B2VE5fZLr87S5MJP3l4JeRwC`, is known as the Prefix. While closely related, they represent different aspects of the identifier:

- AID: This is the formal concept of the self-governing identifier, representing the entity and its control.
- Prefix: This is the practical, usable string representation of the AID. It's derived directly from the AID's initial cryptographic keys and is constructed by combining:
    - A Derivation Code: Indicates the cryptographic suite (key type, signature algorithm, hashing algorithm) used.
    - The Encoded Public Key: The public portion of the initially generated key pair associated with the AID.

**Prefix Self-Certification:**  
KERI AIDs are self-certifying. This works because the identifier's prefix embeds the necessary public key information directly within it. Because of this, anyone who has the prefix can cryptographically check signatures made with the matching private key. This proves actions related to the AID are authentic without needing to check with outside authorities or registries. **Keep in mind, this direct checking applies to the key that is currently authorized for the AID; key rotation changes the authorized key, requiring reference to the AID's KEL for verification.**

<div class="alert alert-prymary">
  <b>📝 SUMMARY</b><hr>
    <li>The AID is the secure, self-managed identifier</li>
    <li>The prefix is the actual text string you use to represent that AID, whose structure makes the AID's self-certifying property work</li>
    <li>The alias (<code>my-first-aid</code> in our example) is just a <b>local</b> nickname within your keystore to easily refer to the prefix</li>
    <li>The terms AID, identifier, prefix, and alias tend to be used interchangeably</li>
</div>




<div class="alert alert-info">
  <b>ℹ️ NOTE</b><hr>
    As you may have figured out, most of the <code>kli</code> commands require a keystore. Assume from now on that <code>--name</code> and <code>--passcode</code> refer to the keystore access.  
</div>

## Displaying the Identifier
You can check the status of the identifier you just created using `kli status` and its `alias`. This command will show details about the AID's current state, including its Alias, prefix, sequence number, public keys, and additional information. More details on what all this data means will be explained later


```python
# Check the status of the AID using its alias
!kli status --name {keystore_name} \
    --passcode {keystore_passcode} \
    --alias {aid_alias}
```

    Alias: 	my-first-aid
    Identifier: BHt9Kw8oUgfB2kiyoj65B2VE5fZLr87S5MJP3l4JeRwC
    Seq No:	0
    
    Witnesses:
    Count:		0
    Receipts:	0
    Threshold:	0
    
    Public Keys:	
    	1. BHt9Kw8oUgfB2kiyoj65B2VE5fZLr87S5MJP3l4JeRwC
    


## Displaying the KEL
You can use `kli status` with the `--verbose` parameter to show the key event log.


```python
!kli status --name {keystore_name} \
    --passcode {keystore_passcode} \
    --alias {aid_alias} \
    --verbose
```

    Alias: 	my-first-aid
    Identifier: BHt9Kw8oUgfB2kiyoj65B2VE5fZLr87S5MJP3l4JeRwC
    Seq No:	0
    
    Witnesses:
    Count:		0
    Receipts:	0
    Threshold:	0
    
    Public Keys:	
    	1. BHt9Kw8oUgfB2kiyoj65B2VE5fZLr87S5MJP3l4JeRwC
    
    
    Witnesses:	
    
    {
     "v": "KERI10JSON0000fd_",
     "t": "icp",
     "d": "EG23dnLAUA4ywPcu2qbokplb2cb1XlIOw24iIKYtR3v4",
     "i": "BHt9Kw8oUgfB2kiyoj65B2VE5fZLr87S5MJP3l4JeRwC",
     "s": "0",
     "kt": "1",
     "k": [
      "BHt9Kw8oUgfB2kiyoj65B2VE5fZLr87S5MJP3l4JeRwC"
     ],
     "nt": "0",
     "n": [],
     "bt": "0",
     "b": [],
     "c": [],
     "a": []
    }
    


Here are some descriptions of the KEL fields:
- `v`: Version String
- `t`: Message type (`icp` means inception)
- `i`: Identifier Prefix
- `kt`: Keys Signing Threshold (the `isith` value used in `kli inception`)
- `k`: List of Signing Keys (You get as many keys as defined by the `icount` value used in `kli inception`)

## Displaying the keystore Identifiers

You can also list all the identifiers managed within this keystore. To illustrate this, let's create an additional Identifier


```python
!kli incept --name {keystore_name} \
    --passcode {keystore_passcode} \
    --alias "my-second-aid" \
    --icount 1 \
    --isith 1 \
    --ncount 0 \
    --nsith 0 \
    --toad 0
```

    Prefix  BBuVNJvbJD2WNduQ0JUGRVGb6uKYrF5bO5T4gdGt_ezO
    	Public key 1:  BBuVNJvbJD2WNduQ0JUGRVGb6uKYrF5bO5T4gdGt_ezO
    


Now use `kli list` to list all the identifiers managed by the keystore


```python
# List all Identifiers in the keystore
!kli list --name {keystore_name} --passcode {keystore_passcode}
```

    my-second-aid (BBuVNJvbJD2WNduQ0JUGRVGb6uKYrF5bO5T4gdGt_ezO)
    my-first-aid (BHt9Kw8oUgfB2kiyoj65B2VE5fZLr87S5MJP3l4JeRwC)
