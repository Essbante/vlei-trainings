    "## Introduction to Delegated AIDs\n",
    "\n",
    "In KERI, delegation is a powerful mechanism that allows one AID (the delegator) to authorize another AID (the delegate) to perform certain actions. This is achieved through a cooperative cryptographic process where both parties participate in establishing the relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects of KERI delegation include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cooperative Establishment: The creation (inception) and subsequent management (e.g., rotation) of a delegated AID requires actions from both the delegate (initiating the request) and the delegator (confirming and anchoring the event). \n",
    "- Cryptographic Binding: The delegated AID's prefix is a self-addressing identifier (SAID) derived from its own delegated inception event.  This inception event, in turn, includes the delegator's AID, creating a cryptographic link.\n",
    "- Anchoring: The delegator anchors the delegation by including a \"delegated event seal\" in one of its own key events.  This seal contains the delegate's AID, the sequence number of the delegated event, and a digest of that delegated event. \n",
    "- Delegated Authority: The delegator typically retains ultimate establishment control authority, while the delegate might be authorized for specific non-establishment events or further, limited delegations. \n",
    "- Hierarchical Structures: Delegation can be applied recursively, enabling the creation of complex hierarchical key management structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will walk through the KLI commands to perform delegated inception and delegated rotation, illustrating how these concepts are put into practice."
