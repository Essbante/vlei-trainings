    "## Defining ACDCs\n",
    "\n",
    "In KERI, verifiable claims are exchanged using **Authentic Chained Data Containers**, **ACDCs** for short. An ACDC is like a digital envelope that's been cryptographically sealed. You can put data inside (like a name, an authorization, or a membership status), and the seal guarantees who created it and that the contents haven't been tampered with since it was sealed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A feature of ACDCs is that they allow different parties (represented by their AIDs) to securely share and verify pieces of information or claims about themselves or others. They are KERI's secure implementation of the broader concept of Verifiable Credentials (VCs). "

    "ACDCs rely on the concept of **Self-Addressing Identifiers (SAIDs)** to create identifiers for data. The SAID is generated by hashing the content it represents, after placing '###' characters as a placeholder for the SAID attribute in the data, and finally embedding the SAID within the data it is a digest of, making the data and its identifier mutually tamper-evident. SAIDs are a crucial part of ACDCs and will be presented later in the definition of credential schemas. "

    "\n",
    "* **Authenticity:** Every ACDC is digitally signed by its issuer (`i` field). Using the issuer's KEL (Key Event Log), anyone can verify that the issuer actually created and authorized that specific ACDC.\n",
    "* **Integrity:** The ACDC's own identifier (`d` field) is a SAID. This means the identifier is a cryptographic hash (digest) of the ACDC's contents. If anything in the ACDC changes (even a single character), the SAID will no longer match, proving it has been tampered with.\n",
    "* **Schema Verification:** The schema defining the ACDC's structure is also identified by a SAID (`s` field). This ensures that everyone agrees on the structure and rules the credential must follow, and that the schema itself hasn't been tampered with.\n",
    "* **End-Verifiability:** Like all things in KERI, ACDCs are designed to be verifiable by anyone who receives them, relying only on the ACDC itself and the issuer's KEL, without needing to trust intermediaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features make ACDCs a robust foundation for building trustable digital interactions, from simple claims to complex authorization workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand the basic concept of an ACDC, the next step is to learn how to define its structure using **schemas**. In the next notebook, we'll dive into creating ACDC schemas and making them verifiable with SAIDs."

    "    Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDCs) are KERI's version of verifiable credentials, acting as cryptographically sealed envelopes for sharing verifiable claims. They rely on Self-Addressing Identifiers (SAIDs)‚Äîunique IDs derived from the content itself‚Äîto ensure integrity. An ACDC consists of an 'Envelope' with metadata (like version v, its own SAID d, issuer AID i, and schema SAID s) and a 'Payload' containing the actual data (attributes a), optional links to other ACDCs (edges e), and optional rules (r). ACDCs provide authenticity via the issuer's signature, integrity through their SAID, schema verification via the schema's SAID, and are end-verifiable using the issuer's KEL.\n",
