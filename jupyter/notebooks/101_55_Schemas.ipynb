    "## What is a Schema?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can issue or verify an Authentic Chained Data Container, we need a blueprint that describes exactly what information it should contain and how that information should be structured. This blueprint is called a **Schema**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schemas serve several purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Structure & Validation:** They define the names, data types, and constraints for the data within an ACDC. This allows recipients to validate that a received ACDC contains the expected information in the correct format.\n",
    "* **Interoperability:** When different parties agree on a common schema, they can reliably exchange and understand ACDCs for a specific purpose (e.g., everyone knows what fields to expect in a \"Membership Card\" ACDC).\n",
    "* **Verifiability:** As we'll see, ACDC schemas themselves are cryptographically verifiable, ensuring the blueprint hasn't been tampered with."
