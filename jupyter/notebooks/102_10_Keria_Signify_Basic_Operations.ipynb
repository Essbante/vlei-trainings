    "### Initiating AID Inception\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a new AID is an asynchronous operation. When you request the Keria agent to incept an AID, the agent starts the process, which might involve communicating with witnesses. The `signify-ts` library handles this by first giving you an \"operation\" object, which you can then use to poll for the completion of the inception process.\n",

    "- **aidAlias (string):** This is a human-readable alias that you assign to the AID within your Signify client's local storage. It's used to refer to this AID in subsequent client operations. It's not part of the KERI protocol itself but a convenience for client-side management.\n",
    "- **inceptionArgs (object):** This object contains the configuration for the new AID:\n",
    "  - **toad (number):** The Threshold of Accountable Duplicity. This is the minimum number of witness receipts the controller (your Client AID via Keria) requires for this new AID's events to be considered accountable.\n",
    "  - **wits (array of strings):** A list of AID prefixes of the witnesses that this new AID should use. These witnesses must be discoverable by your Keria agent (e.g., pre-loaded during Keria's startup or resolved via OOBIs by the client/agent).\n",
