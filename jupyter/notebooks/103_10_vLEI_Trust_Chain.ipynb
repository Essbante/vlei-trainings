    "- **QVI Credential**: GLEIF issues a \"Qualified vLEI Issuer\" credential to the QVI.\n",

    "- **ECR Auth Credential**: The LE issues an \"Engagement Context Role\" authorization credential to the QVI.\n",
    "- **ECR Credential (Path 1)**: The LE directly issues an ECR credential to the Role holder.\n",

    "This notebook provided a practical walkthrough of a simplified vLEI trust chain using Signify-ts, demonstrating:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><b>Hierarchical Trust:</b> Each credential in the chain cryptographically references its authorizing credential, creating a verifiable link back to the Root of Trust (GLEIF).</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Multiple Issuance Paths:</b> The vLEI ecosystem supports different issuance models, including direct issuance by a Legal Entity (for ECRs) and authorized issuance by a QVI on behalf of an LE (for OORs and ECRs).</li>\n",
    "<li><b>IPEX Protocol:</b> The Issuance and Presentation Exchange protocol facilitates the secure delivery of credentials between parties using a grant/admit message flow.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Schema Compliance:</b> Every credential adheres to a specific, SAID-identified vLEI schema, ensuring interoperability and consistent data structures.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Credential Chaining:</b> The 'edges' section of an ACDC is used to reference the SAID of a source credential, explicitly defining the chain of authority.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
